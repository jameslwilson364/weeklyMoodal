## Project 1- Mental Health Tracker

User Stories

- As a user I want to track how I was feeling today and save the data.
- As a user I want to capture sleep, water in take, mood & stress
- As a user I want to be able to provide my input to single or multiple days (7 day week)
- As a user I want to see recommendations based on how I felt for the entire week

Acceptance Criteria

- I capture the user’s mental health (sleep, mood and stress) inputs and water intake, and save them in a calendar day
- I am able to capture user inputs for mental health and water consumption and save those items for the calendar week
- I am able to provide feedback to the user making recommendations based on how they felt that week


Learning and Motivation

- What was your motivation? There are a myriad of devices and applications that a user could pull data points from regarding their physical and mental well being.  The team wanted to create a simple and easy to use tracking tool that doesn’t overwhelm the user.

- Why did you build this project?  The project offered an opportunity to tie together multiple technologies & techniques that aimed to deliver a solid UI/UX that does not overwhelm the user.

- What problem does it solve? The application would allow the user to track their progress throughout the current week.  The user would receive daily recommendations for helpful YouTube videos tied to their mood. The app will add weather data to infer how climate may have affected their well being.  At the end of the week the user would receive a modal summarizing their week and offer a YouTube playlist based on the weekly inputs.

- What did you learn? API development for YouTube, further refinement of openweathermap API, forEach loops, modal development/display, .this usage!, further refinement of parsing arrays with JSON, the bulma css family, and a whole lot more.
